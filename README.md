Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customer. They wanted to modernize thier operations. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did a very thorough job of finding their software vulnerabilities. When I found them, I reported back and fixed the errors in the files I could. Software security means everything to a company because one breach of data could mean their entire customer base could have their information exposed. That, ultimently, leads to the company not being trusted and used in the future. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found that the static testing was challenging just because of the sheer number of vulnerabilities that were found. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I gave Artemis Financial a mitigation plan that itentified steps needed in order to mitigate their vulnerabilities in the future. Within that, I recommended uses to have two-factor authentification and having all systems/files/software updated to latest versions. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I used different testing techniques such as JUnit tests to ensure code was functional and secure. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used JUnit testing, Maven dependencies, dynamic testing, static testing, and sheer determination to ensure that the code was up to par with competition. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them how I went through a specific set of testing techniques to ensure the safety of the company.
